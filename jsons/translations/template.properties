Odin Allfather = 
Hail to you, mighty Odin Allfather, ruler of the Nine Realms and sovereign of Asgarheim! Forged in the eternal fires of Ginnungagap, Asgarheim rose as a dominion of gods and mortals, where wisdom and war intertwine. From the branches of Yggdrasil to the golden halls of Valhalla, your empire flourished, guided by the runes and bound by fate. After the fall of the Vanir and the twilight of the Aesir, the echoes of your power still thunder across the realms, awaiting rebirth. = 
O wise and battle-hardened Odin, the world trembles at the memory of your might. Will Asgarheim rise once more to unite the realms under your watchful eye? Will your wisdom and wrath reshape history itself? = 
By Gungnir and thunder, we ride to war! = 
A bold move... or a final one. = 
Even gods must sleep... for a time. =
